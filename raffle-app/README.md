## 🎟 Buidl NFT Raffle App (Blockchain/Web3 App)   

Simple NFT raffle application where the owner of the contract can put an NFT up to be raffled. Users can then purchase raffle entries and the owner can then select a random winner. We'll build our own custom raffle smart contract and then built our application.
